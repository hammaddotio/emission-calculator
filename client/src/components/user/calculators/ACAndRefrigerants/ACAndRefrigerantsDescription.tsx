                This sheet is designed to systematically calculate and quantify fugitive emissions from various sources within industrial and operational activities. Fugitive emissions are estimated by summing the quantities of gases present in refrigeration systems, purchased gases, gases disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner, and the remaining gases at the end of the reporting period.
