Purchases include: for inventory, as part of equipment servicing (not from inventory), within purchased equipment, and gas returned to the site after off-site recycling. Sales/disposals include: returns to the supplier, sales or disposals (including within equipment), and gas sent off-site for recycling, reclamation, or destruction.
